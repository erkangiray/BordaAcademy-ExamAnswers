In Spring 2020, I applied for an internship/training programme at Borda technologies, which was a medical technology startup based in Izmir, Turkey. First they said they would have an exam to pick out the promising candidates for their internship program. They sent me an exam with a deadline of two weeks. The exam had around 12 questions in it, and the questions required coding. This depository contains two of my "answers" to the exam they sent me.

They ended up not accepting my application. This was after I succeeded in the exam phase and after I had the post-exam interview. They didn't reply with any updates even though it was two weeks past the day they were supposed to announce the results. When I emailed them about my results, they said they were not taking me and that the reason was me not being a fourth year student... So they made me do a twelve question coding exam, and then an interview, just to decline me for not being a fourth grade student yet. I was a third grade student...
