# BordaAcademy

In Spring 2020, I applied for an internship/training programme at Borda technologies, hardware dept.

They sent an eight questions application exam. These were my answers for the questions that demanded some coding.

BCDq4 can take strings of decimal base numbers, and can convert them to binary coded decimals. 10 becomes 0000 0001 0000 0000.
